void dummy_caide_function () {
/*
dummy.cpp: force creation of static library in VsCaide plugin.
Feel free to remove this file when you add at least one 'real' cpp file.

Also, note how documentation for the function is *inside* its definition.
This is a workaround, because otherwise the comment would be included
into the final submission. In general, avoid top level comments in your library.

This style works too:
void function_definition()
// comment
{
  function_implementation();
}
*/

}
