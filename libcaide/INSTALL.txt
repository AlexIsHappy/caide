== Windows build
0. Install Python 2 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
1. Install Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 from here: https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html.
    * Select a path WITHOUT SPACES or other special characters.
    * UNCHECK the 'modify PATH' setting during install.
2. Install MSYS from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
3. Haskell Platform currently comes with an old g++ version. You'll have to copy the
contents of your mingw installation into the folder (Haskell Platform path)\mingw.
4. Open MSYS shell and CD to libcaide source directory.
5. Edit the file mingw32.sh according to the installation path of Haskell Platform.

All of the following is done in MSYS shell, from libcaide directory.

6. Setup PATH:
    > source mingw32.sh
    (Note: you can copy the file to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<username>\.bashrc to
    avoid having to do this every time you open a new MSYS shell.)
7. Update package database:
    > cabal update
8. Initialize cabal sandbox:
    > cabal sandbox init
9. Install dependencies:
    > cabal install --only-dependencies
10. Build:
    > cabal configure
    > cabal build
Resulting executable: dist\build\caide\caide.exe
