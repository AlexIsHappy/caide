== Windows build
1. Install Python 2 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install Haskell Platform 2014.2.0.0 from here: https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html.
    * Select a path WITHOUT SPACES or other special characters.
    * UNCHECK the 'modify PATH' setting during install.
3. Install MSYS from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
4. Haskell Platform currently comes with an old g++ version. You'll have to copy the
contents of your mingw installation into the folder (Haskell Platform path)\mingw.
5. Clone source code repository and submodules from your favourite GUI git
client or command line:
    > git clone https://github.com/slycelote/caide
    > cd caide
    > git submodule init
    > git submodule update

6. Open MSYS shell and CD to libcaide source directory.
7. Edit the file mingw32.sh according to the installation path of Haskell Platform.

All of the following is done in MSYS shell, from libcaide directory.

8. Setup PATH:
    > source mingw32.sh
    (Note: you can copy the file to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<username>\.bashrc to
    avoid having to do this every time you open a new MSYS shell.)
9. Update package database:
    > cabal update
10. Initialize cabal sandbox:
    > cabal sandbox init
11. Install dependencies:
    > cabal install --only-dependencies
12. Build:
    > cabal configure
    > cabal build
Resulting executable: dist\build\caide\caide.exe
The first build will be quite long; later rebuilds take much less time.
13. Optionally: reduce executable size
    > strip dist/build/caide/caide.exe


== Linux build
1. Prerequisites:
  * python 2
  * reasonably new g++
  * ghc >= 7.8. Latest ghc can be downloaded here: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.
  * latest cabal. Can be downloaded here: https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html.
  * zlib and gmp development packages. (In Debian: apt-get install zlib1g-dev libgmp10-dev.)

To run tests, you will also need mono. In Debian: apt-get install mono-gmcs binfmt-support.

2. Clone source code repository and submodules:
    > git clone https://github.com/slycelote/caide
    > cd caide/libcaide
    > git submodule init
    > git submodule update

3. Update package database:
    > cabal update
4. Initialize cabal sandbox:
    > cabal sandbox init
5. Install dependencies:
    > cabal install --only-dependencies
6. Build:
    > cabal configure
    > cabal build
Resulting executable: dist/build/caide/caide
The first build will be quite long; later rebuilds take much less time.
7. Optionally: reduce executable size
    > strip dist/build/caide/caide
